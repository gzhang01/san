Under the sponsorship of Cambridge City Councillor Nadeem Mazen, we have 
been meeting with as many activist groups in the Boston Area as possible, 
from education-oriented groups, to feminist groups, to individuals supporting 
social justice in Gaza. This semester, as we have been starting up, we have worked 
most closely with the Agora, a startup working to enable greater citizen 
access to and involvement in local government, Third Wave, a women's group 
at Lesley University that put on a workshop for feminists across campuses, 
a citizen who worked admirably to convene concerned citizens to talk about 
what we can do here to support rebuilding Gaza, and a Harvard graduate 
student working to put on "flash seminars" as chances for university students 
and community members to talk informally about current issues.
