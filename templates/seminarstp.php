<h2>Flash Seminars</h2>

<p>
Flash Seminars are one-time discussions that bring together students and 
residents of Cambridge to explore thought-provoking topics. Typically lasting 
between one and two hours, Flash Seminars are announced only a few days in 
advance through a mailing list. They are open to anyone but capped at 15 
participants to encourage discussion. The topics of seminars will be generated 
by participants, but will tackle a range of relevant and interdisciplinary 
topics with broad appeal, such as Is Google Making Us Stupid? or Mass 
Incarceration in America or The Politics of Food. Each seminar has a 
facilitator, who typically introduces the topic before leading a discussion. 
Flash Seminars are meant to challenge conventional pedagogy and spark creative 
learning.
