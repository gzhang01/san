<h2>Endorsing SAN</h2>

<p><b>We need your help</b></p>

<p>
SAN is currently meeting with as many activist groups as possible in an 
effort to secure endorsements and expand our group database. The more 
endorsers and the larger our database, the better we can help groups to 
network themselves and engage in collaboration efforts. If you are a member 
of a student activist group in Boston and are interested in our services, 
please consider officially endorsing SAN.
