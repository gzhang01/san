<h2>Student Activist Conference</h2>

<p>
We will be holding monthly conference that any interested activists may 
attend. The purpose of the meetings will be to update each other on progress, 
to expand social networks, and to brainstorm and problem-solve together. An 
emphasis will be put on finding ways to unite projects under common themes 
and to share skills and experience. This will also be an excellent opportunity 
to learn about what is happening in the Cambridge area and how to better 
integrate your efforts in the community.
